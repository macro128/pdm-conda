A PDM plugin to resolve/install/uninstall project dependencies with Conda.

## Configuration

| Config item                       | Description                                                                                          | Default value       | Possible values                | Environment variable            |

All configuration items use prefix `pdm.tool`, this is a viable configuration:

```toml
[tool.pdm.conda]
runner = "micromamba"
channels = ["conda-forge/noarch", "conda-forge", "anaconda"]
dependencies = ["pdm"]
as-default-manager = true
solver = "libmamba"
excludes = ["pytest-cov"] # don't install with conda even if it's a dependency from other packages
installation-method = "copy"
batched-commands = true

[tool.pdm.conda.pypi-mapping]
download-dir = "/tmp"

[tool.pdm.conda.optional-dependencies]
extra = ["anaconda:ffmpeg"] # non python dependency, obtained from anaconda channel

[tool.pdm.conda.dev-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest"]
```

## Usage

This plugin adds capabilities to the default PDM commands.

### Working commands

The following commands were tested and work:

* `pdm lock`
* `pdm install`
* `pdm add`:
    * To add a Conda managed package `--conda` flag can be used multiple times followed a package (analogue
      to `--editable`).
    * You can specify per package Conda channel using conda notation `channel::package`.
    * You also can specify a default Conda channel with `-c` or `--channel`.
    * With flag `-r` or `--runner` you can specify the Conda runner to use.
* `pdm remove`
* `pdm list`
* `pdm info`

### How it works

#### Using conda/libmamba solver

PDM invokes Conda solver to resolve conda packages each time a PDM candidate makes a change in the last Conda
resolution.

If only Conda packages are used (i.e. setting `conda.as-default-manager` to `true` and no `conda.excludes`) then Conda
solver is invoked only once.

### Settings overriden

In order to use Conda to install packages some settings were overriden:

* `python.use_venv` if conda settings detected in `pyproject.toml` this setting is set to `True`.
* `python.use_pyenv` if conda settings detected in `pyproject.toml` this setting is set to `False`.
* `venv.backend` if conda settings detected in `pyproject.toml` this setting is set to `conda.runner`.
* `venv.location` if conda settings detected in `pyproject.toml` and `VIRTUAL_ENV` or `CONDA_PREFIX` environment
  variables are set then this setting is set to the value of the environment variable.
* `install.parallel` if some Conda managed packages are to be uninstalled or updated this option is disabled
  momentarily.

Some environment variables were overridden too:

* `PDM_IGNORE_SAVED_PYTHON` if conda settings detected in `pyproject.toml` and `VIRTUAL_ENV` or `CONDA_PREFIX` environment
  variables are set then this variable is set to `True`.
* `PDM_IGNORE_ACTIVE_VENV` if conda settings detected in `pyproject.toml` and `VIRTUAL_ENV` or `CONDA_PREFIX` environment
  variables are set then this variable is set to `False`.

## Development

For development `docker-compose` files exist in `deploy` directory, helper script `deploy/docker-compose.sh` can be used
for executing docker.

For running dev environment:

```bash
bash deploy/docker-compose.sh -d up
```

And for productive environment:

```bash
bash deploy/docker-compose.sh up
```
